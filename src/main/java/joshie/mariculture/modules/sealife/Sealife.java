 *  Things in this module will have limited use. They are mostly there

 *  aesthetic mobs to help liven up the Ocean. 
 *  Each item should be able to be individually turned off in this module.
 *  As this module will generally be the cause of lag, due to transparent textures, 
 *  moving mobs and just generally */
