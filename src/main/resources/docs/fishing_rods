To have your fishing rods be compatible with mariculture, and allow different things to be caught in different locations,
all you need to do is to add
lootcontext$builder.withPlayer(this.angler);
lootcontext$builder.withLootedEntity(this);

When building your context. Angler should be the players location, Looted Entity should be the bobber.
If this is a machine, you always just create a fake player/entity and pass them in with the correct coordinates, assigned to them.
