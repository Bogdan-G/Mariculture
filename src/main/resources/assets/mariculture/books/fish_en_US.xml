    <text>Bucket Hats are items that can be worn on your head. They have special effects when you fish while wearing them, depending on which colour they are. They come in various colours, one for each pearl colour as well as the default. To craft the coloured ones simply surround a bucket hat with 8 of the pearls you wish to dye it. The next few pages will list what each colour does.</text>
